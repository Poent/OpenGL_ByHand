# OpenGL_ByHand

This is a personal project i'm using to learn c++ and OpenGL. 

Project goals:
1. Get foundational OpenGL classes made. Should be flexible enough to make multiple types of objects.
2. Create a small 2D "Mars Lander" game that randomly generates line segments with one flat landing zone, and navigates the lander safely down. 
3. Implement lmgui.
4. recreate the 2d "flock of birds" simulation.
5. perform flock of birds simulation based on compute-shader.
6. Load a 3D mesh from file and use the mouse to rotate it. 
7. Recreate flock of birds simulation in 3D space.
8. Load a 3D mesh and texture
9. apply lighting
10. apply advanced effects
